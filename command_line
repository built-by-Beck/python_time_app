## takes user input for start time and end time then returns total minutes worked 


from datetime import datetime

start_time = input("Enter start time (in 24-hour format, e.g., 0900): ")
end_time = input("Enter end time (in 24-hour format, e.g., 1430): ")

# Convert input times to datetime objects
start_time_dt = datetime.strptime(start_time, "%H%M")
end_time_dt = datetime.strptime(end_time, "%H%M")

# Calculate time difference
time_difference = end_time_dt - start_time_dt

# Calculate total minutes worked
total_minutes = time_difference.total_seconds() / 60

print(f"Total time worked was {int(total_minutes)} minutes.")
